# The beta channel's test (docs/release.md §6): five versions of Auralink,
# signed ad hoc with a test key, published one after another as GitHub
# would hold them, betas as prereleases, on a fake GitHub
# (scripts/update-server -github: an HTTPS proxy that answers for
# github.com and api.github.com itself and refuses every other host, so
# nothing reaches the real one):
#
#   0.1.0-beta.1, 0.1.0-beta.2   betas before any release
#   0.1.0                        the first release
#   0.2.0-beta.1                 a beta of the next version
#   0.1.1                        a fix released after that beta
#
# Each version is built as the release workflow builds it (updates of
# release/mygo.release.json: github and prereleases), so its deltas come
# from what is published at that point. After each publication installed
# versions check for updates with Beta updates on, off or as by default
# (--update-check, -tags updatecheck: update_check.go), and install what
# they find with the real updater: a beta takes the next beta and the
# release, a release ignores betas unless asked, nothing goes back, a
# delta when there is one and the archive when it fails, and with the
# GitHub API refused (its limit) betas fall back to the latest release.
#
# Its own bundle ID (dev.hehehai.auralink.betatest), repository name
# (auralink-test/Auralink) and directory, on a Mac that may be busy with
# other work: no window, no app activated, no key, no clipboard, no helper
# started, no keychain; niced, two jobs, and it stops when less than
# AURALINK_MIN_FREE percent of memory (40) is free. The test key, the
# builds and the fake GitHub are removed at the end (KEEP=1 keeps them in
