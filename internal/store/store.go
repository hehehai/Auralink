// Package store is Auralink's persistence contract: a repository for each
// kind of record. The app uses internal/store/sqlitestore (SQLite through
// the MyGo plugin github.com/egoist/mygo/plugins/sqlite; schema in its
// migrations/*.sql).
//
// Rules:
//   - Repositories are goroutine-safe and may block on I/O: never call
//     them from a MyGo build pass.
//   - Values in, values out: a repository copies what it is given and
//     returns copies.
//   - Not found is an error wrapping core.ErrNotFound.
//   - Blobs (a history entry's audio) are files under the store's
//     directory, referenced by name; the store deletes them with the record.
//
// There is no job queue: a session lives in memory (internal/session, M3)
// and writes one history entry when it ends.
//
// Imports: core.
