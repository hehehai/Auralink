// Package deliver puts a result where the user is typing when it is
// ready: one insert transaction through the helper's text I/O. It reads
// the app in front now and its focused element (textio.focus). When that
// element takes text, the result is pasted there, whichever app it is
// (textio.paste with that app's pid: the clipboard is snapshotted,
// written, ⌘V posted, keys pressed after it, the clipboard restored
// unless someone wrote to it meanwhile). Otherwise nothing is typed and
// the caller shows the answer card, which offers Insert and Copy.
//
// The start app (Request.Target, in front when the shortcut was pressed)
// still matters in two ways: a selection is replaced only there, and its
// auto key is pressed only there. Its focused element must take text
// (Writable) as another app's must: a web page's text is not an input. When
// Auralink itself came to the front (a click on its window), the start
// app is activated again first (macx.Activate): nothing is ever typed
// into Auralink, nor into a password field.
//
// Policy is here, the mechanics in the helper: the restore delay, the
// keys after the paste and whether the clipboard keeps the text are
// params of textio.paste.
//
// Imports: helper/proto.
